## 🔧 Setup Options

### Basic Setup (Works Great!)
Just run `npx hax-ai-interface` - uses smart pattern matching to understand your commands.

### Enhanced AI Setup (Recommended)
For even better natural language understanding, add an AI API key:

1. **Get an API key:**
   - [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) (recommended)
   - [Anthropic Claude](https://console.anthropic.com/)

2. **Configure it:**
   - The setup wizard will guide you through this
   - Or manually edit `~/.hax-ai/.env`

## 📁 File Organization

Your websites are saved locally in:
- **Windows:** `C:\Users\YourName\.hax-ai\sites\`
- **Mac:** `/Users/YourName/.hax-ai/sites/`  
- **Linux:** `/home/yourname/.hax-ai/sites/`

Each site gets its own folder with all files included.

## 🌐 Publishing Your Sites

### Automatic (Recommended)
Just say: **"Publish my site to the web"**

The AI will:
1. Build your site automatically
2. Deploy to [Surge.sh](https://surge.sh) (free hosting)
3. Give you a live URL like `https://my-site-12345.surge.sh`

### Custom Domain
Say: **"Deploy my site to mysite.surge.sh"** for a custom domain.

## 💡 Examples

### 🎓 Faculty Workflow (Resource-First Content Generation)

#### Step 1: Create Course Site
```
You: "Create a site called biology-101"
AI: ✅ Creates the site with all necessary files
```

#### Step 2: Initialize Course Resources
In the **Course Resources** panel at bottom of interface:
1. Select "biology-101" from dropdown
2. Click **"Initialize Resources"**
3. Upload your textbook PDFs, lecture notes, etc.
4. Add relevant URLs (research papers, videos, etc.)

#### Step 3: Generate Rich Content from Your Materials
```
🎯 MAGIC PHRASE: "from my textbook"

You: "Create a new page about cellular respiration FROM MY TEXTBOOK"
AI: ✅ Reads your biology textbook PDF
    ✅ Extracts relevant information about cellular respiration  
    ✅ Generates 3 detailed paragraphs using YOUR textbook content
    ✅ Creates page with college-level terminology and accuracy

Result: Professional page with content like:
"Cellular respiration is a metabolic process that converts glucose 
into ATP through three main stages: glycolysis, the citric acid cycle, 
and the electron transport chain. The process occurs in the 
mitochondria and produces approximately 36-38 ATP molecules..."
```

**💡 Pro Tip:** Always include phrases like "from my textbook", "using my resources", or "from my course materials" to get detailed, resource-based content!

#### Step 4: Continue Building Course Content
```
You: "Add a page about photosynthesis FROM MY BIOLOGY RESOURCES"
AI: ✅ Uses your uploaded biology resources as primary source
    ✅ Creates detailed content about light-dependent reactions,
        Calvin cycle, and chloroplast structure

You: "Create a lesson about DNA replication USING MY TEXTBOOK" 
AI: ✅ Pulls from your genetics textbook chapters
    ✅ Includes proper terminology: DNA polymerase, Okazaki fragments, etc.
```

### 📚 Real Example: Anatomy Course

**What You Upload:**
- `Anatomy_and_Physiology_2e.pdf` (451 MB textbook)
- `lecture-notes-cardiovascular.txt`
- URLs to medical animations and research papers

**What You Get:**
```
You: "Create a new page about the heart"

AI Generates:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🏥 CARDIAC MUSCLE AND ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY

• The cardiac muscle, also known as the myocardium, is the 
  muscular middle layer of the heart wall composed of specialized 
  cardiac muscle cells called cardiomyocytes.

• The electrical activity is controlled by a specialized conduction 
  system including the sinoatrial (SA) node, atrioventricular 
  (AV) node, and Purkinje fibers.

• This system generates and transmits electrical impulses to 
  stimulate contractions in a coordinated sequence throughout 
  the heart chambers.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

**The AI used YOUR textbook content, not generic information!**

### 🌍 Traditional Blog Workflow
```
You: "Create a blog site called travel-diary"
AI: ✅ Creates the site with all necessary files

You: "Add a page about my trip to Japan"  
AI: ✅ Adds page with starter content

You: "Preview the site"
AI: ✅ Opens http://localhost:3000 in your browser

You: "Publish it to the web"
AI: ✅ Deploys to https://travel-diary-12345.surge.sh
```

## 🔧 Advanced Features
```
You: "Edit the About page to include my hobbies"
AI: ✅ Helps you modify existing content

You: "Change the site theme to something modern"
AI: ✅ Updates the visual design

You: "Add a contact form to the contact page"
AI: ✅ Adds interactive elements
```

## 🆚 Resource-First vs Generic AI

### ❌ **Generic AI Tools**
```
You: "Create a page about mitosis"
Generic AI: "Mitosis is a process where cells divide..."
```
*→ Basic, textbook-generic content*
*→ May contain inaccuracies*  
*→ Not aligned with your curriculum*

### ✅ **HAX AI Interface (Resource-First)**
```
You: "Create a page about mitosis"
HAX AI: Reads your uploaded biology textbook...
        Extracts specific information about mitosis...
        Generates content using YOUR textbook's terminology...
        
        "Mitosis consists of prophase, prometaphase, metaphase, 
        anaphase, and telophase. During prophase, chromatin 
        condenses into visible chromosomes, each consisting 
        of two sister chromatids joined at the centromere..."
```
*→ Uses YOUR course materials as the primary source*  
*→ Maintains academic accuracy and your preferred terminology*  
*→ Aligned with your specific curriculum and textbooks*  
*→ Creates content that matches your teaching style*

**This is the difference between generic AI and intelligent resource-first content generation.**

## 🪄 Magic Phrases for Resource-First Content

### 🎯 **Phrases That Trigger Rich, Textbook-Based Content:**

**✨ The Magic Words:** `"from my textbook"`, `"using my resources"`, `"from my materials"`

#### **Perfect Examples:**
```
✅ "Create a page about mitosis FROM MY TEXTBOOK"
→ Gets detailed content with proper terminology from your biology book

✅ "Add a lesson about the Revolutionary War USING MY HISTORY RESOURCES"
→ Uses your uploaded documents and PDFs as primary source

✅ "Generate content about organic chemistry FROM MY COURSE MATERIALS"
→ Pulls from your chemistry textbooks and notes

✅ "Create a page about heart anatomy FROM MY ANATOMY TEXTBOOK"
→ Uses your 431MB textbook to generate detailed, accurate content
```

#### **⚡ Quick Phrases for Basic Content:**
```
⚡ "Create a page about mitosis"
→ Gets generic, basic content (good for quick placeholders)

⚡ "Add three pages for chapters 5, 6, and 7"
→ Creates basic title pages without detailed content
```

### 🤔 **Troubleshooting Content Generation:**

**Problem:** *"My pages only have titles, no detailed content!"*

**Solution:** Add magic phrases to your requests:
- ❌ **Don't say:** "Create a page about the skeletal system"
- ✅ **Do say:** "Create a page about the skeletal system **FROM MY TEXTBOOK**"

**Problem:** *"The content is too generic, not from my course materials!"*

**Solution:** Be explicit about using your resources:
- ✅ "...using my course materials"
- ✅ "...from my uploaded documents" 
- ✅ "...based on my textbook"
- ✅ "...from my PDF resources"

## 🛠️ Requirements

- **Node.js** 16+ (Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org))
- **Internet connection** (for AI features and publishing)
- **Any modern browser**

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### "Command not found: npx"
**Solution:** Install Node.js from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)

### "Port already in use"

- Check the examples section for working phrases

### "Site won't publish"
**Solutions:**
```bash
# Install Surge globally if needed
